# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format adapted from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) loosely — `0.x.y` releases may break compatibility without warning.

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.5.7] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **Restored push-to-talk out of the box (#27).** v0.5.6 changed the default push-to-talk key to unbound, which left push-to-talk users unable to transmit (no key was bound) so they could not hear each other. Reverted to the previous Caps Lock default so voice works again; a cleaner fix for the Caps Lock capture that does not strip PTT from people who use it will follow.

## [v0.5.6] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **Caps Lock is no longer captured by default (#27).** Push-to-talk shipped bound to Caps Lock, and the keyboard hook cancels that keys toggle while it is the PTT key, so Caps Lock silently stopped working. PTT is now unbound by default; bind any key (Caps Lock included, if you want it) in Settings.
- **Proximity volume no longer flaps to silence on brief drop-outs (#27).** A single dropped position update on a lossy or VPN connection used to blip a peer to silence and back; the client now holds the last volume for a short grace window before fading, which smooths voice on unstable links.

## [v0.5.5] — 2026-06-24

### Changed
- Champion classifier retrained on the current-patch Community Dragon icon set (game patch 16.13.1).

## [v0.5.4] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Ally proximity** toggle (Settings): hear teammates by distance (the same vision-range falloff as enemies) instead of always at full volume. Off by default; takes effect on the next position update, no reconnect needed. (#22)

### Notes for self-hosters
- Needs the matching server build, which adds an optional allyProximity flag to /compute-volumes. Back-compat: older clients omit the flag and keep full-volume allies, so deploy order does not matter.

## [v0.5.3] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- Double/echoing voices and overly quiet allies/enemies. Peer voice was unintentionally playing through two audio paths at once (an HTML audio element plus a WebAudio gain node); it now uses a single path, so there's no echo and levels are correct.

## [v0.5.2] — 2026-06-06

### Changed
- **Relicensed from PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 to the GNU AGPLv3** — now free and open source with network copyleft (commercial use allowed; modifications, including server-side, must be shared under the AGPLv3).
- Routine champion-classifier refresh against the current Community Dragon icons — no functional tracking change (upstream re-encoded the icon files).

## [v0.5.1] — 2026-06-05

### Changed
- Champion tracking classifier rebuilt on Community Dragon's official champion icons (replacing the prior icon source). Equivalent-or-better tracking, and new champions and skins are now picked up automatically.

## [v0.5.0] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- **Champion tracking reverted to the v0.3.1 classifier.** The whole v0.4 line — NCC/SSIM template matching (v0.4.0), then a teal ring/annulus detector with an angular-coverage gate — turned out more brittle in real games than the classifier it replaced: it under-locked (holding/stale between locks) and drifted onto minion lanes, turrets, and the occasional ward/effect ring, especially on the small minimap where dense minion clusters defeat the coverage gate. Real-game testing showed the pre-v0.4 classifier keeps the dot on your champion noticeably better, so tracking is restored to v0.3.1's implementation (its known-bad v0.3.0 confidence gates were already removed). Every non-tracking improvement since v0.4.0 is kept — including the contamination fix below.
- **Cross-team (enemy) proximity is now a single vision-range falloff.** Enemies fade in very faintly at roughly a champion's sight range (~1350u) and get louder as they close, replacing the old two-tier scheme (audible only within ~600u by default, ~1200u with a toggle) which felt too close. Allies are unchanged (always full volume).

### Fixed
- **No proximity audio when two or more players shared one network** (a household or premade on a single public IP). The server rate-limited the volume endpoint per IP, so multiple clients behind one NAT blew the limit and *every* request came back 429 — the client never received peer volumes, so everyone was silent. The limit is now keyed per player (IP + name) and sized for the maximum scan rate, with a per-IP backstop against abuse; players sharing a network each get their own budget.
- **The Debug tracking dot corrupted tracking while Debug was on.** The desktop capture the tracker analyzes included the overlay, so the red position dot was fed back into the computer-vision input as a spurious blob. It no longer renders into the captured region.

### Removed
- **"Hear enemies at full vision range" setting.** Cross-team hearing is always on at vision range now (see Changed), so the toggle and its plumbing are gone.
- The v0.4 computer-vision scaffolding (template-matching module, HSV color-detect module, Data Dragon icon templates) and the Debug "Harvest CV crops" tooling, all of which existed to support the now-reverted template/annulus tracker.

## [v0.4.4] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Tracked position occasionally teleported across the map (broadcasting a wrong location, breaking proximity audio).** With detection + identity now solid (v0.4.0–v0.4.3), the remaining failure was the *re-acquisition* logic: when your champion briefly wasn't found near its predicted spot, the tracker grabbed the highest-scoring blob **anywhere on the minimap** — and it scored blobs on a *relative* (normalized, best-blob = 1.0) confidence that can't tell the real champion from the least-bad of a frame full of wrong blobs (minion dots, ally icons the looser v0.4.3 detection now also picks up). So it would lock onto a far wrong blob and snap your position to the opposite corner. Both the long-range re-acquisition and the SCANNING→lock transition now also require **absolute** template-match confidence (the raw SSIM score, which real champion blobs clear at 0.56–0.65 while wrong blobs top out ~0.49). Below that bar the tracker holds/extrapolates or keeps scanning rather than chasing a wrong blob — so position stays put instead of teleporting. (This gate is safe only because template matching is reliable; the old 172-class classifier was too weak to gate on, which is why v0.3.1 reverted a similar attempt.)

## [v0.4.3] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Champion tracking dropped the icon intermittently ("clinging" / loss-of-lock), and was fragile across different in-game display settings.** The minimap color detection that finds your champion's ring was tuned with absolute RGB thresholds that assumed a *dark* teal — but analysis of real harvested icon crops showed the ally ring is actually a *bright* cyan, so the old test rejected ~80% of the ring and left the tracker frequently losing it. Rewrote detection in **HSV**, keying on the cyan/red *hue* (which is stable under brightness/contrast/gamma) with loose saturation/value floors. On the real crops this detects ~4-5× more of the ring per frame and stays robust across simulated gamma (0.7–1.5) and saturation (60%) shifts, where the old RGB threshold collapsed. This should noticeably reduce loss-of-lock for everyone, regardless of their League brightness/contrast/gamma settings.

## [v0.4.2] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Settings → Debug → "Harvest CV crops" toggle.** Makes the crop harvester (added in v0.4.1) actually usable without devtools — flip it on from the UI when Debug is on, and it applies to the running game immediately. Saves ~1 labeled crop / 3s of your champion icon to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.proxchat.app\harvest\` for tuning CV detection. Off by default.

## [v0.4.1] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Debug thumbnail clipped at the bottom on scaled displays (#11 follow-up).** The dynamic overlay-window resize treated the panel's logical (CSS) height as physical pixels, so a 125%/150%-scaled laptop got a too-short window that cut off the debug thumbnail (a 100%-scaled monitor was unaffected). The height is now scaled by `devicePixelRatio` before sizing the window.

### Added
- **Opt-in CV crop harvesting (Debug-only developer tooling).** With Debug on and `localStorage 'lolproxchat.harvest'` set to `true`, the tracker saves labeled crops of your champion icon to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.proxchat.app\harvest\` during games, to build a real labeled dataset for measuring tracking accuracy. Off by default, zero cost otherwise. Paired with `scripts/eval_real_crops.py` (classifier vs SSIM template matching on real crops). See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#measuring-cv-tracking-accuracy-real-data).

## [v0.4.0] — 2026-06-03

### Changed
- **Champion tracking now matches against the actual champions in your game instead of a trained classifier.** At game start the app fetches the 10 match champions' icons from Riot's Data Dragon CDN and identifies minimap blobs by **SSIM template matching** against them, rather than running a 172-class neural classifier on every frame. This is the v0.4 CV overhaul ([research + rationale](docs/plans/2026-06-03-cv-tracking-research.md)), and it directly targets the failures seen in real games:
  - **No more clinging to minions and structures** — a minion dot or turret icon has essentially zero structural similarity to a champion portrait, so it's rejected outright. The old classifier had to actively distinguish them and often failed.
  - **No per-champion weak spots** — every champion is matched against its own real icon, so there's no "the classifier is bad at Teemo" failure. (The tricky names that broke the old classifier — Nunu & Willump, Dr. Mundo, Wukong — resolve natively.)
  - **Closes the synthetic-to-real gap** — matching against the real in-game-derived icon removes the "trained on clean wiki art" mismatch entirely.
  - **Lighter** — SSIM against 10 templates is far cheaper than a 172-class CNN per frame; the neural model is off the hot path.
- Approach ported from the open-source [LOL_Minimap_Tracker](https://github.com/Quinntana/LOL_Minimap_Tracker) (grayscale SSIM, best-of-N selection, low acceptance threshold).

### Fixed
- (carried in v0.3.1) Stuck-gain proximity bug + reverted CV-tuning regressions.

### Notes
- The 172-class ONNX classifier is retained only as a **fallback** for when the icon fetch fails (offline / CDN down). It will be removed in a future release once template matching is proven in the wild — please report tracking behavior.
- Requires a one-time per-game fetch of ~10 small icons from `ddragon.leagueoflegends.com`.

## [v0.3.1] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- **Enemy stayed audible at full volume after moving out of range ("hears me no matter where on the map").** The v0.3 server correctly drops cross-team peers beyond the 600u cap (and stale-position peers) from the `/compute-volumes` response entirely, but the client only updated peers *present* in the response — a peer once heard within range kept its last gain forever. Now any connected peer absent from the response is silenced. (In v0.2 the server always returned far peers at volume 0, so the client never had to handle absence.)
- **Tracking clung to minions and structures / refused to lock on for some champions.** Reverted three v0.3.0 computer-vision tweaks that were tuned narrowly to one user's logs and regressed the general case:
  - The classifier-confidence EMA "snap-up" latched onto a single false-high frame from a wrong blob (a minion dot, a turret icon), making the tracker confidently follow it. Reverted to a standard smoothed average.
  - A lock-acceptance gate hard-blocked tracking from locking on whenever classifier confidence was low — normal for champions the classifier is weak on (e.g. Teemo) — so it never locked and never broadcast a position. Removed; the classifier still contributes to scoring, it's just no longer a veto.
  - A post-lock coordinate-suppression window kept stale positions on the server for weak-classifier champions, so peers couldn't hear them. Removed.

### Changed
- **MIC / VOL buttons indicate mute via color only** — the label stays "MIC" / "VOL" instead of switching to "MIC OFF" / "ALL OFF", so the button row doesn't reflow.

### Notes
- A ground-up CV overhaul (per-game template matching against the actual 10 champion icons, replacing the 172-class classifier) is planned for v0.4 — see [`docs/plans/2026-06-03-cv-tracking-research.md`](docs/plans/2026-06-03-cv-tracking-research.md). v0.3.1 stops the regressions in the meantime.

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- **Tiered proximity audio (default-config behavioral change).** Team voice is now always full volume regardless of in-game distance (allies already see each other on the minimap — no info leak). Cross-team voice is capped at ~600 game units by default (auto-attack range) instead of the previous 1200 (champion vision range). A new Settings toggle **"Hear enemies at full vision range"** opts in to the old 1200u behavior for users who want the full social experience. The filter is enforced server-side — a modified client cannot bypass the team or range cap because out-of-toggle peers are simply absent from the `/compute-volumes` response. Volume curve uses the full 1200u falloff in both modes, so a peer at distance X sounds the same loudness regardless of toggle state. Full design rationale in [`docs/plans/2026-06-02-v0.3.0-design.md`](docs/plans/2026-06-02-v0.3.0-design.md).
- **PTT global hotkey now works in-game (#1).** Replaced `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` (which used `RegisterHotKey` — intercepted by LoL's DirectInput layer) with a `SetWindowsHookExW(WH_KEYBOARD_LL)` hook on a dedicated message-pump thread. Same technique Discord/Mumble/OBS use. Default PTT key is **Caps Lock** with a synthetic-input-based LED flip-back so the keyboard light doesn't toggle on every press. Both PTT and toggle-self-mute keys are now rebindable from **Settings → PTT Key / Toggle-mute Key**.

### Added
- **Settings → Hear enemies at full vision range** toggle.
- **Settings → PTT Key / Toggle-mute Key** rebind UI. Click to capture a key; common LoL bindings (Q/W/E/R/D/F/B/P) and modifier-only keys are rejected with a brief warning.
- **CV tracking improvements driven by IXAM's v0.1.33 issue #7 logs:**
  - 5-second cap on continuous holds. Beyond that, the tracker drops back to SCANNING for a full classifier-driven re-acquisition instead of extending the search box. IXAM's logs showed 44-second holds during which the orchestrator was sending phantom coords.
  - Classifier-EMA recovery: a single confident raw score now snaps the EMA up to that value instead of decaying. Prevents a couple of poisoned-to-0 samples from leaving the EMA stuck at 0 for the rest of a 4-minute session.
  - `shouldAcceptLocked` gate on SCANNING→LOCKED transitions: requires either confident composite + classifier-EMA agreement OR a high candidate raw classifier score. Refuses the composite-only "wrong-icon LOCK" pattern that IXAM's logs showed (composite=0.42, classifier=0.00, immediately followed by 8s+ holds).
  - Orchestrator suppresses coords broadcasts for the first 3s after a fresh LOCK if classifier EMA is still near 0 (defense-in-depth against a bad LOCK that holds position without entering the hold-gated path).
- **Debug thumbnail no longer overflows the Settings panel (#11).** Overlay window now dynamically resizes to fit panel content (Settings expanded / Debug thumbnail visible / peer list grown). Click-through hit-rect updates in lockstep so clicks below the shrunk panel pass through to the game.

### Fixed
- Per the above CV improvements, the failure modes from #7's most recent v0.1.33 log set (long holds, classifier-poisoned EMA, composite-only false-LOCK) should no longer manifest.

### Removed
- `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` dependency (replaced by the custom `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook).

### Notes for self-hosters
- Server is back-compat with v0.2.x clients (a v0.2 client omits `team` on join, server falls back to legacy team-blind 1200u behavior). **Deploy server first**, then release the v0.3 client — same rolling deploy pattern as v0.2.0.
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` remains optional (only needed for legacy v0.1.x clients).

### Deferred to v0.3.1
- Mouse-button PTT binding (`WH_MOUSE_LL`).
- CV model retrain (fresh scrape + retrained ONNX). Code-side improvements above ship now; the retrain is queued.

## [v0.2.1] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Champion classifier failed for Nunu & Willump and Dr. Mundo players (#7).** The LCU Live Client Data API returns display names (`"Nunu & Willump"`, `"Dr. Mundo"`) but the classifier label file is keyed by sanitized asset names (`"Nunu"`, `"Dr_ Mundo"`). Exact-match lookup returned `localClassIndex=-1`, every scored blob came back `0.000`, and CV never disambiguated the player's icon after the first SCANNING→LOCKED transition — root cause of the "Woosemines never broadcasts position" symptom in the v0.1.33 issue #7 logs. Added a small display-name → label-name normalization map and lifted the resolver into a pure static for unit testing. Confirmed Wukong is unaffected (display name matches the label directly).

### Added
- `tests/services/champion-classifier.test.ts` — 6 tests covering exact match, normalization for Nunu/Dr. Mundo, Wukong-resolves-directly, and a guard that fails if a future model retrain drops one of the normalized target labels. Client tests now 74 (was 68).

## [v0.2.0] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- **Positions now flow client → server, not peer-to-peer (wire-protocol change).** Replaces the AES-GCM-encrypted-XY-over-WebRTC-data-channel exchange with a direct `coords` WebSocket message; `/compute-volumes` reads peer positions from in-process room state. Removes the entire peer-to-peer position transport — no more blob exchange, no more clock-skew rejections, no more "blob lagging behind" symptoms (closes the root causes of #13 and the design concern raised in #15 by making the encryption layer no longer load-bearing). Server keeps the old `{myPosition, peers}` request shape working so v0.1.33-and-earlier clients keep functioning during the rollout window. See [`docs/plans/2026-06-02-server-side-positions.md`](docs/plans/2026-06-02-server-side-positions.md) for the design.
- **Stale-position window tightened from 60 s → 5 s.** Client sends coords on every ~100 ms position tick and stops sending after CV has been holding/extrapolating for >2 s; the previous 60 s window was loose enough that a peer who hard-disconnected could still affect proximity audio for a full minute. 5 s gives ~3 s of phantom audio worst case while absorbing brief WSS stalls without flickering peers silent.

### Fixed
- **Per-player volume slider felt "clicky" / needed re-grabbing every tick (#12).** The overlay was re-appending every player row to the DOM on every `broadcastOverlayState` event (~10 Hz), which detaches the slider's host element mid-drag and breaks the pointer-event sequence in Chromium. The render loop now diffs the desired peer order against the current DOM order and only reorders when they actually differ — the common case (no change) is a no-op, the slider stays dragged.

### Removed
- `src/services/data-channel.ts` and the entire data-channel surface on `PeerConnection` (`createDataChannel`, `sendData`, `onDataMessage`, `ondatachannel` handler). The WebRTC peer connection now carries audio only.
- `audio.ts` no longer opens a data channel before issuing the offer — the SDP has no `m=application` section in v0.2.0+.

### Notes for self-hosters
- Server is back-compat with v0.1.33 clients. Deploy the server first; clients can roll on the next release without downtime.
- Once all clients in your community are on v0.2.0+, you can remove `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from the server env and (eventually) delete the legacy `computeVolumes` / `encryptPosition` / `decryptPosition` paths from `server/src/volumes.ts`. Not urgent.

## [v0.1.33] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Per-row volume slider (#12).** Bumped width 50→80 px, thumb 10→14 px, track height 4→6 px. The old 50 px slider for a 0-100 range gave ~0.5 px per value step, which felt like clicking through discrete steps rather than dragging smoothly. Now drags continuously.

### Changed
- **Server: reverted volume quantization + jitter from v0.1.26 (#14).** `calculateVolume` now returns continuous quadratic falloff (`1 - (d/MAX)²`) directly — no 5-bucket snapping, no ±5% jitter. The original anti-cheat rationale (limit a modified client's distance precision) was marginal at our user scale, and the audible "cliffs" when peer CV jittered between adjacent teal blobs in real gameplay (visible across issue #7 and #13 logs) made the smoothness cost dominate. The continuous output is deterministic; the client-side EMA smooths transitions naturally without bridging large cliffs.
- Server tests rewritten to assert continuous behavior + a determinism check (same input = same output). Total server tests now 47 (was 46).

### Removed
- `VOLUME_BUCKETS`, `quantizeVolume`, and `jitterVolume` from `server/src/volumes.ts`. No public API change — the `/compute-volumes` response shape is unchanged.

## [v0.1.32] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Per-row volume slider now respects real proximity.** Moving the slider used to immediately play the peer at `slider × 1.0` (hardcoded proximity) before the next 100 ms position tick dropped them back to whatever proximity actually was. Caused a fraction-of-a-second blip of audible playback on each slider movement even when the peer was supposed to be silent. The slider now reads the last server-returned proximity volume from `lastProximityVolumes` and applies on top of it. (`#7`)

### Changed
- **Server: `BLOB_MAX_AGE_MS` widened from 10 s to 30 s.** The L7 logging added in v0.1.31 confirmed that even modest Windows-clock drift (~10-15 s, surprisingly common in the wild) was causing the server to reject every position blob from one user in a session, breaking proximity audio asymmetrically with no obvious failure at the connection layer. 30 s absorbs typical drift; the security tradeoff is a longer replay window for captured blobs, but the volume side-channel is already coarsened by quantization + jitter (v0.1.26).

### Added
- `computeFinalPeerVolume(proximity, slider)` exported from `audio.ts` as a pure helper so the slider math is unit-testable without spinning up AudioService + PeerConnection + WebAudio.
- 6 new tests for the helper (`tests/services/audio.test.ts`): clamping, proximity-0 always-silent, slider-0 always-silent, identity. Client tests now 68 (was 62).

## [v0.1.31] — 2026-06-02

### Security
- **Closed: updater URL injection (H1).** `download_and_apply_update` now refuses any URL that doesn't start with the GitHub release-asset prefix for this repo (`https://github.com/danthi123/LoLProxChat/releases/download/`). Without this check, a compromised frontend could have called the command with an attacker-controlled URL → download + spawn arbitrary binary → full RCE on the user's machine. See [`docs/threat-model.md`](docs/threat-model.md) Part 2 § Update flow.
- **Closed: arbitrary file read (H2).** Renamed `read_text_file(path)` → `read_league_config_file()`. The new command takes no arguments; the path is computed Rust-side from `find_league_install_dir()` and reads only `Config/game.cfg`. Removes the arbitrary-file-read primitive that the frontend used to inherit.

### Added
- `server/src/rate-limit.ts` — in-memory token-bucket + per-IP concurrency limiter. No external dep; ~150 LOC. 13 new server tests (`server/tests/rate-limit.test.ts`).
- `server/src/index.ts` and `server/src/ws-handler.ts` wired through the new limiters: per-IP rate limiting on `/turn-credentials` (60/min) and `/compute-volumes` (15/sec sustained, 30 burst); 256 KB body cap on `/compute-volumes`; WebSocket `maxPayload` 64 KB, 20 concurrent connections per IP, 60 msg/sec sustained per connection. Total server tests now 46 (was 33).
- Clock-skew rejections in `decryptPosition` now emit a structured `[volumes]` warn line with the actual blob age. Was silently returning null, which masked some intermittent voice-issue reports.

### Changed
- `lcu::read_text_file` removed from the Tauri command surface; superseded by `lcu::read_league_config_file`. Sole caller (`Orchestrator.readMinimapScale`) updated to use the new command; the `leagueConfigPath` field on `Orchestrator` is gone.

## [v0.1.30] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- `[Tracking] WARN: position jumped …` now requires both a distance threshold (>500 game-units) AND the existing speed threshold (>2000 u/s) to fire. Previously the speed-only gate produced ~100 false-positive warnings per 5-minute session of normal play (CV pixel-jitter on a stationary champion at high scan rates registered as 2000+ u/s instantaneously). Real recall / teleport / mis-track events still warn.
- Promoted the warn thresholds to named `JUMP_WARN_MIN_UNITS` / `JUMP_WARN_MIN_SPEED` static constants on `TrackingService` for tunability and grep-ability.

### Added
- Two new test cases in `tracking.test.ts` pin the new gating: pixel-jitter at high scan rate now correctly stays silent, and a large-but-slow movement (600 units over 1.5 s) confirms the speed gate still works.

## [v0.1.29] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- **Internal refactor — no user-visible behavior change.** `TrackingService.handleLocked` reduced from 158 lines to ~65 lines of orchestration. Pure scoring/selection math extracted to a new `src/services/tracking-helpers.ts` module (`computeMaxJumpPx`, `computeReacquireThreshold`, `computeBlobScore`, `pickBestBlobInRange`, `pickClassifierReacquisition`). The phase-2 and phase-1 success paths split into named methods (`acquireViaClassifier`, `finalizeLockedFrame`) so the side-effect ordering is explicit. State-mutation ordering preserved; the 42 pre-existing tracking/audio/devices tests still pass against the refactor.
- Extracted the `Blob` interface to its own `src/services/blob-types.ts` so the pure helpers can import it without reaching back into `tracking.ts`.

### Added
- 19 new unit tests for the extracted helpers, covering boundary conditions the inline code never had isolated coverage for: jump-radius minimums, hold-expansion math, stationary-vs-hold threshold interaction, classifier-on-vs-off scoring symmetry, jump-range exclusion. Total client tests now 61.
- `src/core/window-globals.ts` — typed `declare global { interface Window { … } }` for the two app-specific properties used as an ad-hoc cross-module bus. Removes the 4 `(window as any).foo` casts that existed in `overlay.ts`, `background.ts`, and `orchestrator.ts`.

### Removed
- All 7 `as any` casts in `src/` source code. Remaining 5 casts are in `tests/` only (legitimate test-environment mocks and private-method reflection). Dropped 3 vestigial `(console as any).debug` casts in `core/logging.ts` — `console.debug` has been in TS's standard `Console` interface for years.

## [v0.1.28] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- Client-side test coverage for `nextSmoothedVolume` (peer-connection EMA), `setLastPosition` jump-warning behavior (tracking), and `listAudioDevices` synthetic-entry filtering (devices). 42 client tests across 7 files.

### Changed
- Extracted `nextSmoothedVolume` from `PeerConnection.setVolume` as a pure function at module scope so the EMA math can be unit-tested without instantiating a real `RTCPeerConnection`.

### Fixed
- Autoplay-blocked path in `PeerConnection.tryPlay` now logs the peer name and rejection reason instead of swallowing the error silently. Both the initial attempt and the user-gesture retry are visible in debug logs.

### Removed
- `src/core/proximity.ts` and its test — dead client-side proximity math that disagreed with the (now authoritative) server quadratic + bucketed falloff. Footgun for any future code that might have re-imported it.
- `src/core/types.ts::MAX_HEARING_RANGE` — only referenced by the deleted proximity module.
- `src/core/template-match.ts` (~112 lines) and its test — leftover from a pre-classifier CV iteration. Zero callers.
- `src/services/updater.ts::applyUpdateWhenSafe` — uncalled export.
- `src/services/orchestrator.ts::captureCalibrationData` and `resolveLeagueConfigPath` — uncalled dead methods. Both bore stale TODO comments; the install-path one is already solved at session-start via `get_league_install_dir`.

### Security
- Resolved 8 CVEs (1 critical) in `onnxruntime-web`'s transitive `protobufjs` dependency. `npm audit --omit=dev` now reports zero vulnerabilities. Remaining moderate audit findings are in dev-only deps (`jimp`) and don't ship in the exe.

## [v0.1.27] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- `Settings → Hide IP (Force TURN)` toggle. Sets `iceTransportPolicy: 'relay'` on new peer connections so peers never see the user's public IP — voice routes through the TURN relay instead of direct P2P. Default off; adds ~20-100 ms latency.
- `docs/threat-model.md` Part 2: user-facing threat coverage (public IP exposure, server-operator trust, summoner-name visibility, code-signing absence, WebView2 trust, signaling presence enumeration, voice-in-transit). Plus a "what we don't collect" baseline (no analytics, telemetry, fingerprinting, or persistent user IDs).

## [v0.1.26] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- HSV-filtered minimap debug image moved off the scanner window into a thumbnail in the Settings panel. Eliminates the capture-feedback loop that previously required `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`.
- Server-side volume math quantized into 5 buckets (`0`, `0.20`, `0.45`, `0.75`, `1.0`) with ±5% multiplicative jitter. Reduces the precision a modified client can extract from continuous volume values. Audio quality unchanged — client EMA still smooths bucket transitions.
- Signaling server now defaults to Cloudflare Realtime TURN. Self-hosted coturn remains supported as a documented fallback.

### Fixed
- ShadowPlay, Nvidia Game Bar, and OBS now capture the app correctly regardless of Debug state (`#2`). `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` removed entirely.

### Added
- SHA-256 hash of each release exe included in the release body going forward. Per-OS verification commands inlined for ease.
- `docs/threat-model.md` covering cheat / information-leak threats and the rationale behind current calibration.

## [v0.1.25] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- Rolling log retention: keep last 3 sessions (`lolproxchat.log` / `.1.log` / `.2.log`). Restarting the app no longer wipes a session's diagnostics (`#9`).

### Changed
- Verbose `applyPeerVolumes` log throttled to 1 Hz or on summary change (was 10× per second).
- Default `targetVolume` in `PeerConnection` set to 0 instead of 1. Fixes "hear peer at full volume across the map" during the SCANNING phase when the orchestrator's passthrough only sets ally volumes.

## [v0.1.24] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- Auto-recover from WebRTC ICE failure. Initiator re-issues an offer with `iceRestart: true` on `connectionState === 'failed'`. Capped at 2 attempts per peer; counter resets on successful re-connect.
- Per-peer `getStats()` snapshot every 10 s logged in debug mode (connection state, ICE state, selected candidate pair with IP/port/type, RTT, bytes sent/received, packets lost).

### Changed
- `extrapolatePosition` caps velocity magnitude at 10 px/tick before applying. Prevents the runaway where a single CV jump could drift the tracked position 12000 game-units in 500 ms.

### Fixed
- Closing any window now exits the app cleanly (`#8`). Previously closing the panel left the click-through scanner window orphaned over the minimap.

## [v0.1.23] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- `[Tracking] WARN` log when local position changes faster than 2000 game-units/sec — catches CV mis-tracking events that previously had to be inferred from raw position dumps.
- Explicit log line when a peer is created via incoming WebRTC offer (previously only the "Peer joined" path logged the connection).

### Changed
- Per-peer volume EMA alpha capped at 0.3 so even long silent gaps ramp in over multiple ticks instead of snapping to a loud value.

## [v0.1.22] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- Mic and speaker device picker (`Settings → Input Device / Output Device`), persisted to localStorage. Input changes swap the WebAudio source in place — no WebRTC renegotiation needed. Output uses `AudioContext.setSinkId`. (`#6`)
- `Settings → Debug Logs → OPEN` launches Explorer at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.proxchat.app\` for one-click log access.

### Changed
- Log file renamed `proxchat.log` → `lolproxchat.log` for post-rename consistency.

## [v0.1.21] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` granting `core:window:allow-start-dragging` + event emit/listen. Tauri 2 silently denies built-in plugin IPC without an explicit capability — this is why title-bar drag never worked before.
- Mute / mute-all toggles persisted on `Orchestrator` so they survive between sessions and stay stable when toggled outside an active game.

### Changed
- Scanner window split out from the panel. Panel is the draggable UI; scanner is a separate transparent click-through window auto-pinned over the minimap.
- Panel cursor-position polling loop skips the click-through toggle while LMB is held so Windows' native window-drag doesn't get torn down mid-move.

### Removed
- Legacy `proxchat.exe` asset fallback in the auto-updater. New releases ship only `lolproxchat.exe`.

## [v0.1.20] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- ShadowPlay no longer turns off when the app is running (first-pass fix; full resolution arrived in v0.1.26).
- Detects League installed outside the default `C:/Riot Games/...` directory via the LCU lockfile path.
- Window drag works in some configurations (first attempt; capability-based fix landed in v0.1.21).

## [v0.1.19] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- Riot Developer Portal application approved (App ID 809090). README compliance section updated.

## [v0.1.18] and earlier

Initial public iteration: Overwolf → Tauri 2 migration, Supabase-stack → custom 1-container WebSocket signaling server, minimap CV pipeline (HSV color filter + blob detection + ONNX champion classifier), WebRTC P2P voice with AES-GCM encrypted position blobs computed server-side, in-app updater. See `docs/plans/` for the historical design + implementation documents from that period.
